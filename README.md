Android ViewBinding vs DataBinding
In Android, ViewBinding and DataBinding are two separate features that can be used to improve the performance and maintainability of your app.

ViewBinding is a feature in Android that allows you to access the views in your layout directly from your code, without the need to use findViewById. This can make your code more concise and easier to read, because you can access the views directly using the names you gave them in the layout. ViewBinding is implemented using a generated class, which provides access to all the views in your layout as fields. You can use ViewBinding in any class that needs to access the views in your layout, such as activities, fragments, and custom views.

DataBinding is a technique that allows you to bind a variable or an expression to an element in your layout, so that the element will automatically display the value of the variable or the result of the expression. This can be useful for reducing the amount of code you need to write, because you can use data binding to update the elementâ€™s value automatically whenever the variable or expression changes. DataBinding is implemented using a special syntax in your layout files, which allows you to reference variables and expressions in your code directly from the layout. DataBinding can be used in any layout file, and it is often used in conjunction with ViewModel objects, which are responsible for holding and managing the data that is displayed in the app.

In summary, ViewBinding is a feature that allows you to access the views in your layout directly from your code, while DataBinding is a technique that allows you to bind variables or expressions to elements in your layout. Both ViewBinding and DataBinding can be useful tools for improving the performance and maintainability of your app, and they can be used together or separately depending on your needs.
