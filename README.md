Android ViewBinding vs DataBinding
In Android, ViewBinding and DataBinding are two separate features that can be used to improve the performance and maintainability of your app.

ViewBinding is a feature in Android that allows you to access the views in your layout directly from your code, without the need to use findViewById. This can make your code more concise and easier to read, because you can access the views directly using the names you gave them in the layout. ViewBinding is implemented using a generated class, which provides access to all the views in your layout as fields. You can use ViewBinding in any class that needs to access the views in your layout, such as activities, fragments, and custom views.

DataBinding is a technique that allows you to bind a variable or an expression to an element in your layout, so that the element will automatically display the value of the variable or the result of the expression. This can be useful for reducing the amount of code you need to write, because you can use data binding to update the element’s value automatically whenever the variable or expression changes. DataBinding is implemented using a special syntax in your layout files, which allows you to reference variables and expressions in your code directly from the layout. DataBinding can be used in any layout file, and it is often used in conjunction with ViewModel objects, which are responsible for holding and managing the data that is displayed in the app.

In summary, ViewBinding is a feature that allows you to access the views in your layout directly from your code, while DataBinding is a technique that allows you to bind variables or expressions to elements in your layout. Both ViewBinding and DataBinding can be useful tools for improving the performance and maintainability of your app, and they can be used together or separately depending on your needs.

View Binding
First, enable ViewBinding in your app’s build.gradle file:


Next, create a layout file named activity_main.xml with a TextView and a Button:


Next, create an activity class named MainActivity that uses ViewBinding to access the views in the layout:


Here, ActivityMainBinding is a generated class that provides access to the views in the layout. You can use the fields in this class to access the views directly, without the need to call findViewById.

Data Binding
First, enable DataBinding in your app’s build.gradle file:

Next, create a layout file named activity_main.xml with a TextView and a Button


Next, create a layout file named activity_main.xml with a TextView and a Button:


Notice the <data> element and the <variable> element in the layout file. These elements define a variable named message that can be used in the layout. The @={message} expression in the TextView’s text attribute binds the value of the message variable to the TextView.

Next, create an activity class named MainActivity that uses DataBinding to bind the layout to the activity:


Here, ActivityMainBinding is a generated class that provides access to the views and variables in the layout. You can use the fields in this class to access the views and variables directly, without the need to call findViewById or set values manually.

When the Button is clicked, the onClickListener updates the value of the message variable, which automatically updates the TextView’s value through the data binding expression.

This is just a simple example of how to use DataBinding in Android. You can use data binding to bind variables and expressions to many different elements in your layout, and you can also use it with ViewModel objects to manage the data that is displayed in your app.
